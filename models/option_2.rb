# Direct Algorithm:
# - Westport is infallible!  Ballina train is supine, BT must be at MJ to meet WT.
# - In this simulation no freight paths are included. Variables like staff, fuel etc are assumed to be sufficient.
# - BMT duration is 27.  Minimum dwell is 3 minutes. WMT duration is 19 mins.
# - Loop from start to end time creating local or connecting trains depending on path availability
# Fixme: Train times overlap, shouldn't be possible

# option 1 start from middle
# start from Ballina, morning train. Finish in Ballina last connection to Westport.
# make sure each Dublin-Wesport train is connected to:
# for each connection, depending on direction, create a BW or WB train connecting WDW mainline train.
# Gaps if gap exists > 2 trips insert extra train e.g (27 + 19 + 3) * 2 = 98 mins.

# option two linear with decision at end of each block
# or starting from first train
# go up to meet westport
# continue to westport
# check which way next meetup is
# calculate if possible to make another roundtrip, if so do it
# if not wait and then travel up to make connection
# remember bal-fox and wes-cas can be useful trips in and of themselves also

# try 2 fallback to 1
