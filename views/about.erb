    <p class="py-6">“Matyró” (this website) is conceived to be both practical and
      aspirational. At heart it’s simply an online journey planner exclusively
      branded for Mayo people. It should help you to get around Mayo today but
      also to show concretely how easy it would be to provide a service that
      was infinitely better than what’s currently offered.</p>
    <p class="py-6">The actual service itself as mentioned <a
href="#history">elsewhere</a> has been going since 2007. “Phase 1”
      (let’s hopefully call it!) covers a grand total of 15 miles between
      Foxford and Ballina. There are eight trains each way, the first one
      leaving Ballina at 5:05 and the last one arriving back in Ballina 21:32.
      The interval between each train in either direction is about 2 hours on
      average. This makes it a more frequent service than any available in
      Derry, Limerick, Galway or Waterford, numbers four to seven of Ireland’s
      most populous cities. It’s a glimpse of what the service could really be
      like, if it was operated in a way that sought to maximize available
      resources.</p>
    <p class="py-6">It is possible today to get as far as Westport but the service is an
      afterthought to say the least. There are a handful of viable connections
      each way, three in the evening from Ballina (none before 3pm) and a
      couple before lunch from Westport and one in the evening. The travel
      time is competitive but could be much better (50-55 mins), there is the
      penalty of a modal change (though the connection is guaranteed) and day
      returns are not really doable. It’s just about better than nothing but
      people do use it nevertheless. Even for something as simple as a Mayo
      match in Castlebar, it’s not really usable.</p>

    <p class="py-6">Well for one thing it was Christmas and I had time on my hands but it
      was probably the following (excellent) tweet I spotted some time ago
      that first got me thinking about it again:</p>
    <blockquote class="twitter-tweet py-6">
      <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Something we&#39;re discussing locally is the creation of a frequent, reliable rail service for Mayo. Three shuttle trains, meeting in Manulla, could provide an hourly service linking six towns (1/3 of Mayo&#39;s population). Don&#39;t be fooled by the name - we&#39;re serious about this. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MART?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MART</a> <a href="https://t.co/d1d7LW7rZu">pic.twitter.com/d1d7LW7rZu</a></p>

    <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
    <p class="py-6">A few months back I attended the Ballina-Westport county final and it
      was an incredibly frustrating feeling, not just because of the result!
      Hoards of people piling in from both ends of the track in their cars
      (including myself and my uncle), clogging up Castlebar as happens on
      every match day, spoiling it for residents, the station lying idle and
      adjacent to McHale park. The frustration of residents is on record but I
      also thought of all the lost business for Castlebar, how nice it would
      be to have a pint or two before or after the match (depending on if you
      win or lose!) and maybe a bite to eat, mingle with other fans on the
      train. Instead matchday is about the car, the search for parking, the
      driving home when you’re tired, trying to beat the traffic, the
      weather.</p>
    <p class="py-6">Leaving Castlebar with our tail between our legs we passed the
      building site of the bypass of the original bypass, a motorway between
      Castlebar and Westport. What can you say about that in 2023. I’ll say no
      more except that it motivated me to attempt to revive the Maightó
      idea.</p>
    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold" id="how-it-works">How it works</h3>
    <p class="py-6">For a deeper dive into the code you can <a href="/code">check this
        page out</a> but here’s a quick non-technical overview.  All train data is pulled from the same source as the irishrail website/app. On top of
      that I offer 5 different “flavours” of maytró to choose from
      <ul class="list-disc">
        <li>Option 1
          is simply the status quo, just presented to you in a more Mayo-centric
          fashion. You can use this as you would irishrail.ie.
        </li>
        <li>Option 2 improves
          on the status quo by shifting trains around to make better connections
          so all trains are usable.
        </li>
        <li>Options 3 optimizes the use of the Ballina
          railcar while keeping current connections to the Dublin trains.
          Generally trains between Ballina and Westport are direct. Some trains
          only go to Castlebar, due to timing constraints. I schedule trains
          starting with the first real morning train and going until midnight.
        </li>
        <li>Option 4 adds a fictional extra railcar starting from Claremorris
          (inspired by Westport cycle group tweet) to complete the Maytró network!
          The idea here is to run it up and down to Westport while connecting to
          Ballina trains as much as possible given the constraints of existing
          real trains.
        </li>
        <li>Option 5 is as above but extended to Ballyhaunis.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p class="py-6">There are also some limitations to this current iteration worth
      mentioning:
      <ul class="list-disc">
        <li>I assume extra resources when needed for a particular
          option (staff, fuel, extra rolling stock etc) are simply available.
        </li>
        <li> I
          haven’t specifically preserved paths for freight trains as I don’t have
          an information on scheduling (though there are paths available).
        </li>
        <li>The junction layout at Manulla is not
          optimal when two trains have to cross (it’s possible but awkward).
        </li>
        <li>Some options have specific limitations, see page on <a
href="#code">code</a> for more.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p class="py-6">Having admitted the above, these limitations are trivial, taking into
      account the scope of the project itself. This is not metrolink.</p>
    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold" id="why-the-maightró-should-happen">Why the Maightró should
      happen</h3>
    <p class="py-6">No public service will happen unless it is Government policy, and
      there is a lots of relevant policy, past and present, squarely behind
      Maytró.</p>
    <p class="py-6">Starting with the recent past, <a href="https://npf.ie/nss/">The
        National Spatial Strategy (2002 - 2022)</a> while by no means flawless,
      was the superior predecessor of the current National Planning Framework
      which will exacerbate already extreme centralization, to the benefit of
      no-one except the city rentiers. The NSS focused on redressing the
      imbalances of Dublin-centric unconstrained growth, fostering regional
      development by clustering smaller towns together to create something
      akin to city scale or a counter balance to prevailing centrifugal forces
      at least. Among the secondary ‘hubs’ identified was Ballina-Castlebar.
      BellinBar (or is it CashelNah?) never got off the ground. As was the
      case with most of the putative hubs and gateways in the NSS, Dublin ate
      their lunch. Needless to say utilizing the idle railway between the two
      towns a bit better (or at all) might have helped to make a meaningful
      connection between the two something more than an aspiration. In
      conventional urban areas, after all, it is almost always the local genus
      of metro, that embodies both the real and symbolic nervous system
      connecting the disparate parts of the urban.</p>
    <p class="py-6">The <a
href="https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/7bd8c-climate-action-plan-2023/">updated
        climate action plan</a> is a low detail document with plenty of big
      figures, most relevant being percentage cuts in private transport
      emissions. Vague references are made to increased rail “in the cities”
      with the headline scheme that’s not in Dublin, being in Cork. Schemes
      that require hardhats, juicy private tenders and will happen in the
      future, if they do at all. Why not make use of existing rail resources
      to cut emissions tomorrow instead of in five years? Why do regions have
      to wait for “the cities” to get their act together? Maightro is better
      than a “shovel-ready” project as no shovel is required! “Rural people”
      would be less cynical about climate action plans if existing services
      were run in a way that could enable them to drive less. Maightró would
      be climate policy made climate action, something that is sorely needed,
      especially outside “the cities”.</p>
    <p class="py-6">The connecting Ireland mobility plan mandates local bus services for
      all towns with a population over 10,000. In counties with well
      functioning regional public transport, modes compliment each other
      creating a network effect as opposed to ‘competing’ against each other
      in fantasy markets. The Maightró map thus includes bus transfer points
      at Ballina and Castlebar, necessary given the natural hinterland of the
      former and the spread out topography of the latter.</p>
    <h4 class="text-1xl font-bold">Ballina</h4>
    <img src="ballina-bus.svg" alt="">
    <h4 class="text-1xl font-bold">Castlebar</h4>
    <img src="castlebar-bus.svg" alt="">
    <p class="py-6">Another aspect of Maytró is the ambition to run early and late.
      Citizens should be able to use the service not just for daytime
      appointments but also for leisure and nocturnal entertainment. This is
      also consistent with current Government policy. The recent report from
      the Night time economy taskforce (which the current government has
      committed to implement) speaks bout “Public transport as an essential
      support for the NTE” and recommends “Additional Night-Time Economy
      services in rural areas”.</p>
    <p class="py-6">An interesting thought experiment is to consider the difference
      between jumping on a train to go from a bar in one part of Berlin or
      London to a bar in another, a trip that could take 45 minutes or longer.
      Is there any reason why one couldn’t do the same in Mayo (assuming
      Maightró existed, was similarly affordable and ran at night)?</p>
    <p class="py-6">Which brings me onto the last policy document I want to refer to
      here: John Bradley’s excellent <a href="https://275314da-a8aa-42f3-b679-4f2bff339c95.filesusr.com/ugd/33065c_ab5dd92d603d4dac9b205634d153745e.pdf">“Economy
        of Mayo”</a>. EOM is full of sage reflection on the intersection between
      the real economy in Mayo and the policy that frames it, challenging
      popular misconceptions and offering insights into where improvements can
      be made. Chapter 8 “Towards a County Spatial &amp; Economic Strategy”,
      is particularly salient in terms of some of the arguments I’ve made for
      Maightró. In it Dr. Bradley identifies public transport connectivity as
      …’the best way to encourage the evolution of a new enterprise sector in
      Mayo… to link its smaller towns in such a way that the grouping takes on
      some of the functional characteristics of larger “virtual”
      towns…improvements will require imaginative and flexible policies and
      are likely to be relatively low cost when compared to the construction
      costs of motorways”.</p>
    <p class="py-6">There is much to say on this idea of a virtual city, or as I would
      think of it, the distributed urban, as a counterpoint to what I believe
      are anachronistic views on the benefits of urbanization and large
      cities, but I don’t want to digress from Maightró too much here. I’ll
      finish by mentioning a success marker Bradley highlights, namely
      “retaining existing young people in the county” and “attracting
      returning Mayo people to live and work in the county”. In other words
      people who migrate to the city. Cities are made up of villages and towns
      in the same way a county like Mayo is, and citizens love to find their
      village within the hive of the city. The difference between rural and
      urban villages is the level of connectivity and the convenience of it in
      particular, “the death of distance”, as Dr. Bradley refers to it.</p>
    <p class="py-6">Imagine how much interesting Mayo would become to young people if
      nights out were not confined to your own, dreary town. With a well
      functioning Maytró each town would in effect became a “neighbourhood” -
      as the more exciting parts of cities are nowadays marketed as - and
      could be explored if not a will then relatively cheaply and quickly. And
      what neighbourhoods they are, each familiar yet distinctive cluster of
      homes, businesses, lanes, streets, squares, bridges, each on or adjacent
      to magnificent rivers, beaches, bays, lakes, forest and parkland. Quite
      a difference from the dreary inbetweens of the ‘hip’ urban villages that
      city dwellers flock to.</p>
    <p class="py-6">Although this is purely an exercise in creative thinking the effect
      of imagining the same constitutive elements in a different context can
      be transformative, or as Bradly puts it - ‘The Wild Atlantic Way showed
      how better “framing” can produce extraordinary results without
      extraordinary expenditure.’ I propose that the Maightró could have a
      similar transformative effect on the perception of our towns.</p>
    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold" id="summing-up">Summing up</h3>
    <p class="py-6">Maightró is a simple idea that could be massively progressive for
      Mayo. Whether a matter of historical luck or perspicacious design, Mayo
      has been left with five of its six largest towns linked directly by
      rail. Up to half the counties population could be benefiting from high
      quality public transport. This would have a transformative effect on the
      collective perception of the county from within and without. The
      required investment is so negligible as to be not worth mentioning.</p>
    <p class="py-6">Maytró fits neatly into national and local policy frameworks both
      current and past. It requires little extra resourcing, it is rather
      about adopting a new mental model, defining new, heightened expectations
      around what level of service the Irish public can expect, outside
      Dublin.</p>
    <p class="py-6">While other regional cities are starting to talk about implementing
      local rail services (and that is both welcome and overdue), there is no
      reason why Mayo should have to wait at the back of the line. This
      project is ready to go.</p>
    <p class="py-6">The is no reasonable obstacle to implementation, which could be done
      almost immediately, except the mentality of the parties that control
      public transport in Ireland. Despite the mainstreaming of greenwashing,
      and thus the necessity to project a favourable response to any proposal
      for enhanced public transport, I have yet to witness any real commitment
      to public transport provision by the transport troika, Iarnród Éireann,
      the NTA and the Department of Transport. Rather the historical emphasis
      on roads, Dublin and the managed decline of the railway still seems to
      hold sway.</p>
    <p class="py-6">Twenty years ago the original Mayo delegation comprising TDs, urban
      and county councillors, IRD members and others managed to win the
      grudging concession that is the current service today, a foot in the
      door, if you will. I’m sure if such a delegation could be put together
      again today to push the project forward again it would find a much more
      favourable reception.</p>
