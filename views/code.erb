    <p class="py-6">If you are reading this and are technically minded you’ll know from
      your algorithm book of choice that scheduling is one of the canonical
      examples of an NP hard problem.</p>
    <p class="py-6">In the wild, if your research this, common approaches include: -
      mathematical programming e.g. ILP <a href="https://python-mip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html">job
        shop scheduling problem python</a> - heuristics (e.g. genetic algorithms
      <a href="https://github.com/akazuko/timetable_scheduler">python
        example</a>) - simulation
      http://www.opentrack.ch/opentrack/opentrack_e/opentrack_e.html
    </p>
    <p class="py-6">This particular genus of the scheduling problem, Single track
      scheduling, is solved with algorithms that feature common inputs like
      blocks (spaces between stations upon which only one train can be
      scheduled) and certain assumptions that trains can cross at stations not
      always the case in our specific example unfortunately).</p>
    <p class="py-6">Below is a space time diagram to help visualize this <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
            id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>.
      The nodes are stations, the vertices are blocks (think a single track
      stretch), the vertical axis represents time moving forward. Each sloping
      line is a train occupying a block in time. In order to schedule validly,
      sloping lines within a block can’t intersect.</p>

            alt="space time diagram for train scheduling on single track" />
    </figure>
    <p class="py-6">The particular problem this code seeks to solve is the scheduling of
      as many trains as feasible given normal domain constraints (blocks,
      rolling stock) on three intersecting routes… - the Nephin: Ballina -
      Westport - the Covey: Westport - Ballyhaunis - the Costello: Ballyhaunis
      - Ballina. ….and scenario specific constraints (there are four different
      scenarios, the baseline being the current service).</p>
    <p class="py-6">The most obvious brute force approach is simply to cycle through
      every scheduling option, something like (pseudo)…</p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        schedule = []
        blocks = single trains sections
        queue = array of ordered trains waiting to enter first block
        while queue do
        train = trains.pop
        block = next_block(current_station, blocks)
        if block.empty?
            block.train = train
            schedule &lt;&lt; train
        else
            trains &lt;&lt; train
        end
        end
        return schedule
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p class="py-6">This is kind of the approach I take but with some shortcuts to avoid
      unnecessary cycles, i.e something approximating a greedy algorithmic
      approach:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p class="py-6">A greedy algorithm is an algorithmic paradigm that follows the
        problem-solving heuristic of making the locally optimal choice at each
        stage with the hope of finding a global optimum.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p class="py-6">My goal really is to demonstrate that using available resources,
      given a certain scenario, trains <em>could</em> be scheduled a lot
      better. As opposed to finding the optimum scheduling possible or indeed
      verifying that.</p>
    <p class="py-6">This approach also makes sense as I (generally, the exception being
      scenario 2) have give myself the constraint that I can’t reschedule
      already scheduled trains in order to make realising some version of
      Maytró as feasible as possible.</p>
    <h3 class="font-bold font-sans break-normal" id="scenarios">Scenarios</h3>
    <p class="py-6">The baseline is just the current service and I look that up directly
      from Iarnród Éireann’s public (but not published) api, that serves their
      website. This means of course my implementation could and probably will
      break in the future but given the time I was willing to give this, the
      easiest thing was to query directly. I coded this initially as a basic
      cli, you can look up any route.</p>

    <p class="py-6">The realtime data is the source of all the constants - block
      durations, turnaround times, station dwell - used to generate schedules
      in the following scenarios.</p>
    <h4 class="font-bold font-sans break-normal" id="options-1a">Options 1a</h4>
    <p class="py-6">One of the problems with the current Maytró is that about half of the
      trains between Westport and Ballina are unusable due to lousy
      connections between them. The “improved” scenario (option 1a) first
      schedules connecting Ballina Manulla trains (Nephin) relative to the
      time they connect to Dublin - Westport Intercity trains (Covey
      hereafter). Then next part of the algorithm checks for block conflicts
      between the current and next schedule trains and attempts to reschedule
      the next train.</p>
    <p class="py-6">This scenario has one major limitation. Ideally when rescheduling, a
      check would be run to make sure a suitable path is available for all
      affected blocks, in this case I haven’t done it for the following
      reasons: - Covey trains feed into the busiest section of the rail
      network (Portarlington - Dublin) and various shared tributaries of
      single track. Checking the rescheduled train can pass existing trains
      would be non-trivial and… - It turns out the algorithm only needs to
      reschedule a single Covey train to achieve acceptable results and… -
      This option is not my preferred solution, it’s inferior to Option 2.</p>
    <p class="py-6">It would be a nice challenge to go through some weekend.</p>
    <p class="py-6">Incidentally I did supply an approximation of the results of this
      exercise as a submission to the new timetable consultation without
      success or without even receiving what seems to be the new standard
      acknowledgement:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p class="py-6">IÉ in conjunction with the NTA will continue to investigate
        possibilities for implementation at a later stage Driver resources not
        available for implementation</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h4 class="font-bold font-sans break-normal" id="option-2">Option 2</h4>
    <p class="py-6">This is essentially the original “Mayolink” proposal reheated. The
      approach is to start with the earliest Covey connection and schedule as
      many Nephin trains as possible until midnight, making sure to keep
      current connections to and from Dublin. The main difference is that the
      Nephin railcar runs through to Westport, as opposed to requiring a
      change. It’s well documented that changing mode extracts a significant
      penalty in terms of public transport usage, so avoiding it if possible
      is key to providing a good service.</p>
    <p class="py-6">The scheduling optimizations applied are as follows: - Add train if
      time to schedule a full trip from current point to end point and still
      hit next connection - If full trip not feasible, try shortened trip
      (i.e. stop at Castlebar) - If through trip not possible, return to
      destination (same service as baseline)</p>
    <p class="py-6">One limitation is that the station layout at Manulla, the junction of
      the lines, doesn’t have proper crossover facilities. In other words
      trains can pass each other but depending on the direction travelled an
      awkward maneuver is required. Could be easily fixed by the installation
      of a points. Not a deal-breaker either way but worth mentioning.</p>
    <h4 class="font-bold font-sans break-normal" id="option-3">Option 3</h4>
    <p class="py-6">This introduces 15 minute Westport’s Eastern line, referred to here
      as the Costello.</p>
    <p class="py-6">The approach is to schedule as many trips as are feasible using a
      newly introduced railcar (the Costello) to run between Claremorris and
      Westport, connecting with Nephin trains, thus creating unified Maytró
      service with optimal connections to all towns.</p>
    <p class="py-6">The scheduling optimizations applied are as follows: - if railcar is
      in the wrong place (for next connection) run it back - if connection
      possible, make the connection - otherwise just schedule an extra
      Costello service with no connection.</p>
    <h4 class="font-bold font-sans break-normal" id="option3b">Option3b</h4>
    <p class="py-6">For option3b the Costello is extended all the way to the border,
      Ballyhaunis town.</p>
    <p class="py-6">The only optimization here (if you can call it that) is to check if
      the extension causes a scheduling clash and to remove the train if it
      does.</p>
    <p class="py-6">A proper approach would have been to introduce an extra block
      (Ballyhaunis - Claremorris) and schedule from scratch factoring in the
      passing possibilities therein. The approach here is likely not optimal
      but still a significant improvement on the status quo.</p>

    <p class="py-6">Listed below you’ll find some statistics for each option, for each
      possible trip namely: - number of trains scheduled (n) - worst cast trip
