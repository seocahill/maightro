<h3 id="what-is-maytró">What is Maytró</h3>
<p>“Matyro” (this website) is conceived to be both practical and
aspirational. At heart it’s simply an online journey planner exclusively
branded for Mayo people. It should help you to get around Mayo today but
also to show concretely how easy it would be to provide a service that
was infinitely better than what’s currently offered.</p>
<p>The actual service itself as mentioned <a
href="#history">elsewhere</a> has been going since 2007. “Phase 1”
(let’s hopefully call it!) covers a grand total of 15 miles between
Foxford and Ballina. There are eight trains each way, the first one
leaving Ballina at 5:05 and the last one arriving back in Ballina 21:32.
The interval between each train in either direction is about 2 hours on
average. This makes it a more frequent service than any available in
Derry, Limerick, Galway or Waterford, numbers four to seven of Ireland’s
most populous cities. It’s a glimpse of what the service could really be
like, if it was operated in a way that sought to maximize available
resources.</p>
<p>It is possible today to get as far as Westport but the service is an
afterthought to say the least. There are a handful of viable connections
each way, three in the evening from Ballina (none before 3pm) and a
couple before lunch from Westport and one in the evening. The travel
time is competitive but could be much better (50-55 mins), there is the
penalty of a modal change (though the connection is guaranteed) and day
returns are not really doable. It’s just about better than nothing but
people do use it nevertheless. Even for something as simple as a Mayo
match in Castlebar, it’s not really usable.</p>
<h3 id="why-i-built-this-site.">Why I built this site.</h3>
<p>Well for one thing it was Christmas and I had time on my hands but it
was probably the following (excellent) tweet I spotted some months ago
that first got me thinking about it again:</p>
<p><code>&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Something we&amp;#39;re discussing locally is the creation of a frequent, reliable rail service for Mayo. Three shuttle trains, meeting in Manulla, could provide an hourly service linking six towns (1/3 of Mayo&amp;#39;s population). Don&amp;#39;t be fooled by the name - we&amp;#39;re serious about this. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MART?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#MART&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/d1d7LW7rZu"&gt;pic.twitter.com/d1d7LW7rZu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; 15-Minute Westport (@15minWestport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/15minWestport/status/1377996729006616580?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></p>
<p>A few months ago I attended the Ballina-Westport county final and it
was an incredibly frustrating feeling, not just because of the result!
Hoards of people piling in from both ends of the track in their cars
(including myself and my uncle), clogging up Castlebar as happens on
every match day, spoiling it for residents, the station lying idle and
adjacent to McHale park. The frustration of residents is on record but I
also thought of all the lost business for Castlebar, how nice it would
be to have a pint or two before or after the match (depending on if you
win or lose!) and maybe a bite to eat, mingle with other fans on the
train. Instead matchday is about the car, the search for parking, the
driving home when you’re tired, trying to beat the traffic, the
weather.</p>
<p>Leaving Castlebar with our tail between our legs we passed the
building site of the bypass of the original bypass, a motorway between
Castlebar and Westport. What can you say about that in 2023. I can’t say
anything good about it so I’ll say nothing except that it motivated me
to attempt to revive the Maightó.</p>
<h3 id="how-it-works">How it works</h3>
<p>For a deeper dive into the code you can <a href="#code">check this
page out</a> but here’s a quick non-technical overview:</p>
<p>All train data is pulled from the same source as the irishrail
website/app. On top of that I offer 5 different “flavours” of maytró to
choose from:</p>
<p>Option 1 is simply the status quo, just presented to you in a more
Mayo-centric way, let’s say. You can use this as you would
irishrail.ie.</p>
<p>Option 2 improves on the status quo by shifting trains around to make
better connections so all trains are usable.</p>
<p>Options 3 optimizes the use of the Ballina railcar while keeping
current connections to the Dublin trains. Generally trains between
Ballina and Westport are direct. Some trains only go to Castlebar, due
to timing constraints. Generally I started scheduling trains starting
with the first morning train and going until midnight.</p>
<p>Option 4 adds a fictional extra railcar starting from Claremorris
(inspired by Westport cycle group tweet) to complete the Maytró network!
The idea here is to run it up and down to Westport while connecting to
Ballina trains as much as possible given the constraints of existing
real trains.</p>
<p>Option 5 is as above but extended to Ballyhaunis.</p>
<h3 id="why-the-maightró-should-happen">Why the Maightró should
happen</h3>
<p>No public service will happen unless it is Government policy, and
there is a ton of relevant policy, past and present, squarely behind
Maytró.</p>
<p>Starting with the recent past, The National Spatial Strategy while by
no means flawless, was the superior predecessor of the current National
Planning Framework, aka even more centralization. The NSS focused on
redressing the imbalances of Dublin-centric unconstrained growth,
fostering regional development by clustering smaller towns together to
create something akin to city scale or a counter balance to prevailing
centrifugal forces at least. Among the secondary ‘hubs’ identified was
Ballina-Castlebar. BellinBar (or is it CastleNah?) never got off the
ground. As was the case with most of the putative hubs and gateways in
the NSS, Dublin ate their lunch. Needless to say utilizing the idle
railway between the two towns a bit better might have helped to make a
physical link between the two something more than an aspiration.</p>
<p>What makes cities interesting is both the village element and the
wider connections.</p>

<h3 id="limitations">Limitations</h3>
<p>I assume extra resources when needed for a particular option (staff,
fuel, extra rolling stock etc) are simply available.</p>
<p>I haven’t specifically preserved paths for freight trains as I don’t
have an information on scheduling.</p>
<p>Options 2 involves the potential for rescheduling Westport - Dublin
train. This simply assumed to be possible.</p>
<p>The junction layout at Manulla is not optimal when two trains have to
cross (it’s possible but awkward).</p>
<p>Having admitted the above, these limitations are trivial, taking into
account the scope of the project itself. This is not metrolink.</p>
<h3 id="summing-up">Summing up</h3>
<p>Maightro is a simple idea that could be massively progressive for
Mayo. The four largest Mayo town linked together.</p>
<p>Complimented by local buses, pedestrianized town centers and
dedicated cycling infrastructure.</p>
<p>IE have ready made excuses to turn this down but they’re all
bullshit. This is better than ‘shovel-ready’ because no shovels are
required. Just one extra shitty worn out railcar that dublin doesn’t
need anymore painted in red and green.</p>
<p>Why should we have to wait for the Dublin disaster and the 5 new
mini-dublin-disasters of project 2040 to tortuously come round to public
transport investment? Let’s be honest once the ECB induced recession
fully kicks in, they all be cancelled anyways as the absolutely
necessary higher interest rates to fight the evil scourge of full
employment, I mean inflation, will make borrowing in the same infinite
fiat currency that exists on the ECB’s computer that extends infinite
lines of credit to the corporate welfare state, will make public
investment ‘too expensive’.</p>
<p>Is it because it would be embarrassing for good old ‘god help us’
knuckle dragging Mayo to be more progressive than our urban
superiors?</p>
<p>Yes the ring road is being build, yes it is an embarrassment but at
the end of the day the NTA approved it, so they ultimately, are the ones
responsible for it.</p>
<p>We can hit back by providing top quality PT between Wesport and
Castlbar.</p>
<p>Who know maybe one day they’ll turn the Ring Road into a
greenway?</p>
<p>The curious case of the Castlebar - Westport motorway</p>
<p>Was a public transport option surveyed as is legally mandated?</p>

<p>updated climate action plan,</p>
<p>Hyper centralization is ahistorical in the irish context, a legacy of
colonialism. it is also anachronistic in terms of how information flows,
society collaborates operate today which is more distributed, aping the
information networks that carry the bulk of the load. It is victorian
thinking in a technological age. It is also perhaps a legacy of post
2008 europe where democrtic political agency has been curtailed in
general, with the rise of hyper centralized technocratic
adminstration.</p>
<p>Psychological the impact is immense</p>
<p>Imagine london berlin take out bad bits distributed, ecological,
metropolitan area.</p>
<p>University faculties, civil service, greenways lakes beach a
completely different modern vision of what a city could be. The nervous
system linking it together is the railway, as it it with all historical
cities.</p>
<p>The mini dublin strategies are unlikely to succeed. Same developer
led profit led Blanding / Ikeaisation (Limerick / Waterford) examples.
Think Quatar or Croydon town centre.</p>
